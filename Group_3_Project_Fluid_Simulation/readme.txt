Hi,

    This is just a short readme detailing the directory structure of our project to make the grading process a little easier.

Thank you and Happy Holidays,
Group 3

NOTE: Due to the difficulty associated with running OpenGL programs we do not expect you to be able to run the GUI code (we added a link to videos of the simulations running).
All non-GUI code should be able to run in VSCODE 2019.
